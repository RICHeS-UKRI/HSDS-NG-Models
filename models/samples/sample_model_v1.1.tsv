S13/E19: Sample	tooltip	A discrete physical fragment or portion removed from the painting for study or conservation.	object-fs32|																						
S13/E19: Sample	has note	Document Note: Sample Model Overview																							
Document Note: Sample Model Overview	tooltip	This model defines the Sample (S13) as a discrete physical fragment removed from a heritage object for study. It brings together identification, classification, and contextual data, linking each sample to its source object, the sampling event, and any subsequent analytical or modification events. Ownership, custody, and storage are documented to support traceability, while descriptive and measurement links ensure that both qualitative and quantitative observations remain connected to their physical origin.
